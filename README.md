Compilation
-----------

* Getting the source

> git clone --recursive https://github.com/mikrosimage/duke.git  

* Compilation

    see INSTALL file
    
**Known issues**

GCC 4.7 is not supported due to an issue with `std::chrono`, you will need GCC 4.8.
If you use Clang and don't use [Clang's standard library](http://libcxx.llvm.org/) then you will also need to rely on GCC 4.8 standard library.
